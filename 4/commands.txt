EXAMPLE 1:
update driver_stats set d_starts = 208 where d_id =3;
drop table new_record;
create table new_record as 
(select DS.*,D.d_name,D.D_country,D.c_id from driver_stats as DS,
 drivers as D where DS.d_id = D.d_id);
commit;


DRIVERS:
drop table new_record;
create table new_record as 
(select DS.*,D.d_name,D.D_country,D.c_id from driver_stats as DS,
 drivers as D where DS.d_id = D.d_id);

CONSTRUCTORS:
drop table new_constructor;
create table new_constructor as 
(select C.c_name,C.engine_id,C.tp_eid,CS.* from constructors as C, 
constructor_stats as CS where C.c_id = CS.c_id);

WDC:
drop table new_wdc;
create table new_wdc as (select D.d_id,D.d_name,wdc.year from drivers as D, 
wdc where D.d_id = wdc.d_id);

WCC:
drop table new_wcc;
create table new_wcc as (select C.c_id,C.c_name,wcc.year from constructors as C, 
wcc where C.c_id = wcc.c_id);
